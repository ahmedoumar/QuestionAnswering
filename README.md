# QuestionAnswering

 In this Notebook i have built a question answering system based on transformers architecture. I have implemented the "Text to Text Transfer from Transformers" (better known as T5). This implementation has been done using the Trax framework, which is an open source Machine Learning/Deep Learning research framework built and maintained by google brain research team.
